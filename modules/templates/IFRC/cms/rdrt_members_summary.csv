<h3>Finding a particular Member</h3>
<p>
You can find a particular member in the list by using filters. Remember
that it may take a few moments for the list to get updated after you have
changed a filter.

<p>
Note that by default, only active members are shown. You can change
this by selecting/de-selecting the ""Status"" checkboxes in the filter
form.
</p>
<p>
Click the pencil in the member row to open the <a href=""{{name:RDRTMemberProfile}}"">Member Profile</a>.

<p>
Clicking on the trashbin icon removes the member from the RDRT roster. Note
that this does <b>not</b> remove the person data of the member from the
database - and you can re-add the member to the roster at any time.
</p>
<p>
The envelope icon allows you to send a message to this member (per email
or SMS). Note that messages sent to individual members are currently not
recorded in the RDRT module.
</p>
<p>
Note that certain icons may not be shown for a member if you do not have the
required permissions to perform the action.
