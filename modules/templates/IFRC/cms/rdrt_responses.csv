<h3>How Responses to RDRT Alerts are linked to Missions and Members</h3>
<p>
Incoming responses to RDRT alerts are <em>automatically</em> linked
to the respective mission and roster member profile.
</p>
<p>
For this to work correctly, the member must:
<ul>
<li>reply from an email address registered with his profile in RMS</li>
<li>include the <em>mission tag</em> from the alert in the reply</li>
</ul>
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/mission_tag.png""></img>
<p>
Most email programs would automatically include the mission tag
along with the alert message when you just click ""Reply"". That
does not always work, however.
</p>
<p>
Messages which could not automatically be linked to a mission will
appear in the <a href=""{{name:RDRTInbox}}"">Inbox</a>, where
they can be linked manually to a mission.
</p>
<p>
See at the bottom of this page what to do if the message could not
automatically be linked to the correct roster member.
</p>

<h3>How to see the Responses for a particular Mission</h3>
<p>
Open the <a href=""{{name:RDRTMissionsSummary}}"">Mission Profile</a> and
find the ""Responses"" section:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/mission_profile_responses.png""></img>
<p>
Each response card contains:
<ul>
<li>the member name and organization</li>
<li>date and time when the response message was received by RMS</li>
<li>the response message</li>
<li>a list of attachments of the response message</li>
<li>information about previous deployments and performance rating</li>
</ul>
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/response_card_basics.png""></img>
<p>
Click ""more"" to expand the message text on the response card.
</p>
<p>
Attachments can be opened by clicking the file name(s). Use right-click to
download them instead.
</p>

<h3>How to open the Member Profile</h3>
<p>
The member name (not the organization name!) in the response card
is linked to the member's profile containing all necessary
background information.
</p>
<p>
Click the member name to open the profile in a new browser tab:
</p>

<h3>If a Response Message could not be linked to a Member Profile</h4>
<p>
If you see a simple email address in place of the member name, then
the response message could not automatically be linked to a member:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/response_card_unlinked.png""></img>
<p>
You can link the response message to member manually. Click the Edit-icon
on the response card to open a window to edit the response data:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/response_card_link_to_member.png""></img>
<p>
Click into the member field and enter a few letters of the name, select the
member from the drop-down list and click save to link the response message to
this member.
</p>

<h3>How to add Comments</h3>
<p>
You can add comments to response cards, e.g. to make notes or capture
additional information:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/response_card_comments.png""></img>
<p>
Click the Edit-icon on the response card to open the Edit-window, and
then enter your notes into the ""Comments"" box. Click ""Save"" to update
the card:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/response_card_edit_comments.png""></img>

<h3>If a Response Message was linked to the wrong Mission</h3>
<p>
It could happen that a response message was linked to the wrong mission. In this
case you can manually re-assign it to the correct mission.
</p>
<p>
Click the edit-icon on the response card to open the edit window, choose the
correct mission from the drop-down, then click ""Save"":
