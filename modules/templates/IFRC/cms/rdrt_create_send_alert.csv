<p>
The workflow to create and send alerts consists of 3 steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create Alert</li>
    <li>Select Recipients</li>
    <li>Send Alert</li>
</ol>
<h3>Creating an Alert from the Mission Profile</h3>
<p>
In the Mission Profile, click the ""Create Alert"" button:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/mission_profile_create_alert.png""></img>
<p>
...to open a form to create a new alert for this mission:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/create_alert_mission.png""></img>
<p>
Click ""Save"" to save the alert - this will not send the alert just yet,
but store it in the database, and open another view where you can select
recipients.
</p>

<h3>Creating an Alert from the Side Menu</h3>
<p>
Alternatively, from the left menu choose ""Create"" under ""Alerts"":
</p>

<p>
...to open a form to create a new alert:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/create_alert.png""></img>
<p>
Click ""Save"" to save the alert - this will not send the alert just yet,
but store it in the database, and open another view where you can select
recipients.
</p>

<h3>Selecting Recipients</h3>
<p>
After creating a new alert, you will be directed to a tabbed view of the alert.
</p>
<p>
On the ""Select Recipients"" tab, you see a list of all roster members. You
can use filters to find particular roster members:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/alert_select_recipients.png""></img>
<p>
Check the boxes on the left for those members you want to add as alert
recipients. You can use the ""All"" checkbox at the top to select/deselect
all members currently listed.
</p>
<p>
Then, click ""Add as Recipients"" (Do not forget this step!).
</p>
<p>
You can repeat this step as many times as you need. Use the ""Recipients""
tab to verify which recipients have been added:
</p>

<h3>Sending an Alert</h3>
<p>
You can send the alert directly from the ""Select Recipients"" tab by
clicking the ""Send"" button:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/alert_view_send_alert.png""></img>
<p>
Alternatively, you can return to the Mission Profile, where the alert is
marked as ""not sent"". Click the ""Send Alert"" link on the alert card to
send the alert, or click the edit icon to modify the alert message or add
more recipients:
