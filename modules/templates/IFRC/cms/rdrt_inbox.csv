<h3>Opening the InBox</h3>
<p>
To open the InBox, use the ""InBox"" link in the left menu:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/side_menu_inbox.png""></img>
<p>
The InBox view shows all incoming response messages to RDRT Alerts which could
not automatically be linked to a mission.
</p>
<p>
It is useful to check the InBox from time to time after you have sent out
a new alert.
</p>

<h3>How to link a Response Message to a Mission</h3>
<p>
Click on the ""Link to Mission"" button for the respective message in the InBox:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/inbox_messages.png""></img>
<p>
This opens a page with the message details at the top, and a list of missions
underneath:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/inbox_select_mission.png""></img>
<p>
If the sender email address of the response message is not registered for
any RDRT roster member, you will see a small input box at the top of the
link-to-mission dialog:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/inbox_unknown_sender.png""></img>
<p>
You can use this input box to manually identify the member who sent the
message: type in a few letters of the member's name to see a list of
possible matches, then select the member from that drop-down:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/inbox_select_member.png""></img>
<p>
If you forget to choose a member before linking the message to a mission,
you can still do this later in the <a href=""{{name:RDRTResponses}}"">mission profile</a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, to link the message to a mission, click the ""Select Mission"" button
in the respective row. This will link the response message to that mission, so
that it will now appear in the <a href=""{{name:RDRTResponses}}"">responses
section of the mission profile</a>:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/inbox_linked_message.png""></img>
<p>
Note that once the message has been linked to a mission, it will no
longer appear in the InBox.
</p>

<h3>How to delete Messages from the InBox</h3>
<p>
If you want to delete a message from the InBox, click on the delete-icon:
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/inbox_delete_message.png""></img>
<p>
You can also delete multiple messages at once: check the boxes in the
leftmost column to select the messages you want to delete, and then click
the ""Delete""-button at the top.
</p>
<img src=""{{c:static,f:themes,noargs}}/IFRC/img/cms/inbox_bulk_delete.png""></img>
